# Smart-Meters-Forecasting

This repository contains two key components aimed at analyzing smart meter data and implementing deep learning models for predictive analytics.

1. **Spark-based EDA for Smart Meter Data:**
The first file leverages Apache Spark to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large-scale smart meter dataset. By harnessing the distributed computing capabilities of Spark, the EDA process efficiently processes the voluminous data, extracting valuable insights and patterns. Spark's scalability and parallel processing capabilities enabled seamless exploration of the dataset's characteristics and correlations, facilitating informed decision-making and actionable insights.

2. **Deep Learning Models for Predictive Analytics:**
The second file focuses on training deep learning models for predictive analytics using the smart meter data. This includes implementing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The primary objective is to compare the performance of these advanced models against an arbitrary baseline model, providing insights into their effectiveness for forecasting and predictive tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes Apache Spark for scalable EDA on large smart meter datasets.
- Implements five deep learning models for predictive analytics: LSTM, CNN, GRU, RNN, and MLP.
- Compares model performance against an arbitrary baseline for evaluation and benchmarking.
- Provides insights and recommendations based on analysis results for informed decision-making.
